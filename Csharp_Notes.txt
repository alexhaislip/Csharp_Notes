Compiling the code:
 
The csc.exe executable file usually is located in the Microsoft.NET\Framework\<Version> folder under the Windows directory. Its location might vary depending on the exact configuration of a particular computer. If more than one version of the .NET Framework is installed on your computer, you'll find multiple versions of this file. For more information about such installations, see How to: determine which versions of the .NET Framework are installed.


To compile:

	Csc hello_World.cpp

	Default compiled binary file name is (fileName.exe)

Commenting: 

	// for single line comments  
	/* for multi line comments */  
	/// XML tags displayed in a code comment


Re-naming compiled files:
	
	csc hello_World.cs -o hello.cs

Data Types:

	bool	Boolean value	True or False
	byte	8-bit unsigned integer
	char	16-bit Unicode character
	decimal	128-bit precise decimal values with 28-29 significant digits
	double	64-bit double-precision floating point type
	float	32-bit single-precision floating point type
	int	32-bit signed integer type
	long	64-bit signed integer type
	sbyte	8-bit signed integer type
	short	16-bit signed integer type
	uint	32-bit unsigned integer type
	ulong	64-bit unsigned integer type
	ushort	16-bit unsigned integer type


	object obj;
	obj = 100; // this is boxing

	String str = "Tutorials Point";

Outputting to the terminal:
	


Debugging:

	creating a debugging file using -ggdb flag, similar to creating the .exe but this 	will do both. (VS Code)
